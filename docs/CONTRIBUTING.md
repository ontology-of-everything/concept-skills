# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to [concept-skills](https://github.com/ontology-of-everything/concept-skills).

## Quick start

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Add or edit a skill under `skills/<name>/` (runtime only).
3. Add matching QA under `qa/<name>/` with `validate.sh` and optional `evals/`.
4. Register the skill in `docs/catalog.yml`.
5. Run `./tools/install-git-hooks.sh` once, then `./tools/validate-all.sh` before opening a PR.

See [authoring.md](authoring.md) for conventions. Per-skill version lives in `qa/<name>/VERSION`; changelog in `qa/<name>/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Pull requests

- One skill or one focused change per PR when possible.
- Keep `skills/<name>/` installable — no test assets inside skill folders.
- Update `docs/skills/<name>.md` and README skill table for new or changed skills.
- CI must pass (`validate` workflow).
