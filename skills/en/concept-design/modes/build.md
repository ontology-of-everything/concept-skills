# Build

Inputs: confirmed specifications, project conventions, scoped source/manifests/tests.
A review/plan MUST NOT edit files.

1. Identify scoped actions, queries, result cases, invariants, rules, execution constraints, and extra observable behavior.
2. Apply [architecture constraints](../references/architecture.md) and the target section of [language mapping](../references/language-mapping.md).
3. Implement or refactor within scope while preserving confirmed behavior and stable identities.
   Update moved specifications, exports, dependencies, and PRD indexes.
4. Use [execution and recovery](../references/execution.md) for rule execution and applicable migration.
5. Run affected concept, composition, protocol, assembly, and architecture checks.
   Verify contract items, OPs, and application scenarios separately.

Resolve known contract/architecture violations within authorized scope.
